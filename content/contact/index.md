        We are continuously recruiting postdoctoral researchers in the fields of engineering geology and geotechnical engineering. We welcome doctoral students with relevant foundational or research experience in machine learning/deep learning, soil environment, geothermal energy, multi-field coupling, numerical calculation analysis, etc.  
        Applicants are invited to apply for postdoctoral positions in the following research areas: 
          1) Engineering geological issues under extreme climate conditions: Mainly focusing on slope stability, we will develop multi-field coupled (thermal-water-gas-mechanical) models, conduct research on soil variables using machine/deep learning methods, etc. We are seeking 1-2 postdoctoral researchers with a foundation in multi-field coupled numerical and experimental work, as well as experience in developing machine learning/deep learning. 
          2) Ecological Geotechnical Engineering: Mainly conducts research on soil respiration, soil carbon sequestration mechanisms, urban green space carbon cycle, and the development of biochar applications. We plan to recruit 1-2 postdoctoral researchers with relevant research experience in soil environment, soil-plant interactions, and indoor/outdoor experimental testing. 
          3) Other interdisciplinary fields related to engineering geology, ecological environment, and new energy: such as research directions in coal gasification, geothermal energy, and deep CO2 storage, etc. We welcome inquiries.
