PhD student. Email : 12212114@zju.edu.cn

I am a PhD student admitted in 2022. I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Chongqing University. My current research focus is on the mechanism of moisture migration in unsaturated residual soil under evaporation and its impact on the rainfall threshold of landslides.
