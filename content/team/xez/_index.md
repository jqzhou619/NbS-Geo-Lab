PhD student. Email : 12212113@zju.edu.cn

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Zhengzhou University and have been a direct PhD student (admitted in 2022) ever since. My main research fields are machine learning and geological engineering, with a specific focus on the interaction model between atmosphere, plants and soil.
