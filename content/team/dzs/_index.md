PhD student. Email : ZhishengDai123@163.com

I am from Dali, Yunnan Province. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Huazhong Agricultural University in 2018, along with a double bachelor’s degree from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). From 2018 to 2021, I pursued a master’s degree in Soil and Water Conservation and Desertification Combating at Beijing Forestry University, with my research focus on mountain disaster prevention and control. Between 2021 and 2023, I worked in the investment and financing management position at Yunnan Construction Infrastructure Investment Co., Ltd. Since September 2023, I have been studying for a PhD degree at Zhejiang University, and my current research direction is the development mechanism of group geological disasters.
