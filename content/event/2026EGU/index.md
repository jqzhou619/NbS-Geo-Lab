Venue Introduction:

Climate change alters precipitation and temperature patterns, thereby influencing soil moisture, vegetation, groundwater and surface runoff, and thus exacerbating hydrogeological disasters. These changes result in significant differences in the triggering conditions of floods, landslides and droughts in terms of time and space, posing challenges to traditional methods relying on historical records. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising path by combining multi-source observations with physical constraints learning to depict complex processes and introducing future climate scenarios to enhance community resilience. This session will explore the integrated application of AI and hydrogeological disasters under the climate-driven context, with a focus on modeling, assessment and decision support. Key issues include: How can AI models reflect complex physical processes and update trigger thresholds dynamically? How can multi-time-scale climate variability and CMIP6 scenarios be embedded while maintaining physical consistency? In a non-stationary context, how can the robustness of predictions be ensured and better serve early warning and climate resilience planning? 

We welcome research submissions addressing the aforementioned challenges, with a focus on AI, climate scenarios, and multi-scale process coupling. The topics include:
Slides can be added in a few ways:

1. **Artificial Intelligence for Hydrogeological Disasters:** 
- Flood, landslide and drought prediction and warning based on machine/deep learning (risk mapping, monitoring and real-time alerts).
- Conducting AI-driven coupled disaster modeling using multi-source data, integrating rainfall, surface water, groundwater and geological processes.
- Application of remote sensing and big data in disaster identification, evolution tracking and mapping (satellites, drones, radars, etc.).
- Assessing the impact of climate variability and extreme events on disaster occurrence.
- Using the CMIP6 scenarios and bias correction, downscaling in combination with methods for AI training and inference.
- Physical process modeling, such as the hydrological interaction between the atmosphere, vegetation and soil. 
- Explainable AI and decision support systems, used for transparent disaster management, urban planning and engineering measures.

2. **Assessment and Decision Support under Climate Change Scenarios:**
- AI-driven or GIS-based decision support platforms for adaptive management, policy formulation and disaster mitigation.
- Assessing the social and economic vulnerability, resilience and trade-offs of adaptation under climate change. 
- Evaluate natural and sustainable solutions as strategies for climate resilience planning.
